# 👋 About me
I am a **Ph.D. student** in the School of Aerospace Engineering and Applied Mechanics, **Tongji University**, supervised by Prof. [Zhang Zhen](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhen-Zhang-52).

My research interest includes **Nonlinear Dynamic**, **Deep Learning** application in **structure health monitoring (SHM)** scenarios. I have published numerous papers at the top international journals with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FKjwZekAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> ( <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FKjwZekAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
