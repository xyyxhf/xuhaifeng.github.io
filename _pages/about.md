[**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=FKjwZekAAAAJ&citation_for_view=FKjwZekAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='FKjwZekAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC'></span></strong>
- The adaptive low-rank approximation minimization framework is used to adaptively select the larger singular values related to the strong correlation information within the matrix samples. The dynamic penalty factor is introduced to establish a classification model, which can weaken the influence of unbalanced samples on model training and improve the classification performance.
